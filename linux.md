# Linux

## General linux hardening

### Disable ptrace

Add `kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 3` in `/etc/sysctl.conf` and use `sysctl -p` to activate the new setting, value `2` and `1` allow the use of ptrace for related processes, see the [doc](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/security/Yama.txt) for more information.

### Hide the pid of process not owned

To test dynamically:
```
mount -o remount,rw,hidepid=2 /proc
```
To make this changement at boot, this line needs to be added to the `/etc/fstab` file
```
proc /proc proc defaults,hidepid=2 0 0
```

### Hide syslog and kernel pointers to users

Put this text into `/etc/sysctl.conf` and then run `sysctl -p` to update the changes:
```
kernel.dmesg_restrict = 1
kernel.kptr_restrict = 1
```

### Harden fs protections

* https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-add-nodev-nosuid-noexec-options-to-temporary-storage-partitions/
* https://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/2220-create-and-protect-tmp-partition

Maximize the `nosuid,noexec` on all fs that don't need it:
* /dev/shm
* /tmp

Those 2 lines can be added to `/etc/fstab`:
```
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0
mqueue /dev/mqueue mqueue defaults,rw,relatime,noexec 0 0
```
or tested applied without reboot:
```
 mount -o remount,rw,relatime,noexec /dev/mqueue
 mount -o remount,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec /dev/shm
```

### For allocation of new TTY for sudo

To avoid this attack: https://www.errno.fr/TTYPushback.html

Add this to `/etc/sudoers`

```
Defaults use_pty
```

## Ssh configuration hardening

### New install

On a new install, it's always good to regenerate the server's keys especially on a hoster you don't know with:

```dpkg-reconfigure openssh```

### Hardening
Change `Port` to something else than 22

Increase `ServerKeyBits`

Set `PermitRootLogin` to `no`

Set `LoginGraceTime` to a low value like 15, it's the number of seconds you have to type the password

Set `DebianBanner` to `no` (depends on OS), prevents broadcasting system informations

### Util

`AllowUsers` to only allow few users to use ssh

## Disable password auth
To disable password authentication and just use RSA key auth:

`UsePAM` to `no`

`PasswordAuthentication` to `no`

`ChallengeResponseAuthentication` to `no`

## Password storage configuration

```/etc/login.defs```
Be sure to check `ENCRYPT_METHOD` is using a secure hashing algorithm, it's also a good thing to increase `SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS` to a higher value for better security.
`UMASK` is the default rights for new user creation.

```/etc/skel/``` contains file being copied for new user. It's important to check that other groups don't have rights on ```/home/xxx```.
chmod /home directories

## IPv6

Put inside `/etc/sysctl.conf`
```
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1
```

Apply with `sysctl -p`

## APT

Check that ```/etc/apt/sources.list``` is using correct deb package to have good download rates.

### Switching to unstable

Switch all packages to `unstable main contrib non-free`

## Services

On a default installation, some services are not needed and should be disabled, like:
* port 25 (smtp/mail server)
* port 53 (dns)

## Apache

In file `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`, set the following:
```
ServerTokens ProductOnly
ServerSignature Off
```
This will disable the broadcast of apache2 version.

## Gnome configuration

### autolock with gnome-screensaver

```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 300
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-delay 0
```

### disable touchpad when mouse is present

```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad send-events disabled-on-external-mouse
```

### Change the url selection in graphical environnement so you can select an URL with the protocol

```
$ dconf write /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:b1dcc9dd-5262-4d8d-a863-c897e6d979b9/word-char-exceptions '@ms "-,.;:/?%&#_=+@~Â·"'
```

To remove this key and get back to current Ubuntu defaults:
```
$ dconf reset /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:b1dcc9dd-5262-4d8d-a863-c897e6d979b9/word-char-exceptions
```

## Tricks

This folder contains scripts that gets executed for every user on the system.
```
/etc/profile.d/
```
Force the resolution to full HD, put this in `/root/.bashrc`
```
if [ ! -f /tmp/res ]; then                                                      
    xrandr --newmode "1920x1080"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync
    xrandr --addmode Virtual1 1920x1080
    xrandr --output Virtual1 --mode 1920x1080
    echo 'Done' > /tmp/res
fi
```

You can mount remote filesystem thanks to ssh by using `gvfs` on gnome or `sshfs` on any system.
